Project Overview
Create a professional investment-focused website for Madini Moyoni to replace our temporary site (www.madinimoyoni.co.uk). The existing website did not have a premium feel or gloss needed for such an important proposal and it did not explain bothbtiers of investment or position itself to attract UK bassed investors. The new website should be designed specifically to attract investors, build trust in our brand, and showcase the unique value proposition of our mining investment opportunity in Tanzania.

We have both a strategic investment proposal and an SEIS proposal.  This website should incorporate the entire project but be geared towards SEIS investors as that's who we aim to attract. 
This website is to give our UK audience the chance to take part and take advantage of the SEIS Seed funding raise.
A strategic raise is taking place concurrently with our US based audience where the opportunity is building rapid traction and being handled by 
https://www.tielasater.com/ and https://www.linkedin.com/company/globalcapitalista/ during the month of June and July. This gives the website a sense of FOMO and encourages quick engagement. 

 There should be a CTA and section for UK strategic investment included. How the the core function is to attract UK investors keen on social economic change that gives an excellent return. Investors keen on a transparent and sustainabile approach .

Key Objectives
